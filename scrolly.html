            <p><em>Resistant temporalities</em> is a digital humanities project that critiques the way we interact with
                the world around us; the way we perceive time and space, the way we read light, shadow, directions, etc.
                The way we’ve structured and organized our systems is by creating a systematic, one-size-fits-all
                spatial and temporal experience. We live in a world where time is imposed on us, dictated by clocks and
                calendars, leaving us blind to the more intimate, natural ways of understanding our surroundings. What
                if we could reclaim time as something that isn’t handed to us, but something we experience and create
                through our perception of the sun, the moon, the stars, the clouds…?</p>

            <p>We imagine the world by how it’s <em>represented</em> to us - unaware that the representation is the
                blind spot. Time is seen as this unbreakable construct of the universe. <em>Time</em> is constant,
                unquestionable, untouchable, marching ahead. The minute is an objective unit of this unrelenting time.
                You can’t really do anything about it. Then, the minute creates the hour. The hour creates the day, the
                week, the year, the decade. Why is it that way? Probably the sun, right? So it must be like, an
                objective observation? Right? We can’t do anything about the sun, duh.</p>

            <p>Why can’t we touch it? And change it? And perceive it with different temporal imaginaries?</p>

            <p>Space is the same. We move based on a layering of satellite data, we imagine our streets, our rivers, our
                rooms, as how they look drawn, or seen from above. We can’t touch it. The map is what the map is.
                …right?</p>

            <p>Since the dawn of time, humans have been eating, sleeping, travelling, planting, harvesting, conversing,
                joking, flirting, all with the concepts surrounding them. We decided on how long we’ve been in the sun
                by how it feels on our skin. To understand the time, where we are in the week, or the month, or the
                year, was a look up, instead of a look down at some abstract number. This isn’t an unknown concept. ‘The
                ancients’ used to tell time with the stars, with the sun, etc, <em>but that’s too archaic for us. Clocks
                    are easier. They’re the same after all. Just easier.</em></p>

            <p>What if I told you that your clock face, those numbers on your home screen, are not an objective measure
                of the movement of the Earth around the Sun.</p>

            <p>Instead, imagine, they are decided concepts. They have been tweaked over time as a colonizing concept, to
                overcome and undermine the hundreds of thousands of temporal definitions that exist around the world,
                and to fit every environment, every person, every plant, every animal, into a ticking time frame. Time
                wasn’t meant to be dictated to us. It is something you deduct. Like when you’re hungry. Or when to eat.
                Or <em>what</em> to eat. Imagine if there was a building somewhere in Europe, sending notifications to
                everyone around the world about when to eat. Wouldn’t that feel silly? <em>Of course. I can eat now or
                    later. Time is different. I can’t just decide it on my own.</em> Is it? Time was, for hundreds of
                thousands of years before the sundial, an open source project. Time can be read from the sun, the
                clouds, the shadows, the leaves, precise time could be told with the stars, the moon, the movement of
                water, or of sand, or of weights. The world hasn’t changed since then. Our exposure to it has, and our
                awareness of it has, but the stars move the same (15 degrees per hour, or the distance of the length of
                your palm, if you hold it up to the sky and close one eye), the moon moves the same (cycles through 28
                phases in a month, but also moves precisely 0.5 degrees per hour, meaning you can tell the time down to
                the minute, or even the second), the sun moves the same, etc. All you really ever had to do was look up.
            </p>

            <p>Time isn’t meant to be one digital monoculture, flattened further and further into a linear, marching,
                Westernized concept of how to interact with the world and move through it.</p>

            <p>There are countless threads in which we can trace and study the changes in our perception of time, how we
                went from looking up and squinting to know how far I am from home, to a google maps notification, but
                the two most interesting to me, is our timekeeping devices, and the language we use to describe it.
                These are two unrelated concepts (for now).</p>

            <p>(same with space, allocentric mapping, etc.)</p>

            <p>What makes us so</p>

            <p>o is a layering of maps that explores temporal and spatial environmental concepts to break our reliance
                on and imperial, linear, politicized digital time and space.</p>

            <p>Our temporal and spatial disconnect from our surroundings, and our complete reliance on handheld
                navigation and dictated time-telling - has homogenized the world and flattened it into a monoculture.
                The tools we have used to harness and quantify time and space now operate as a blind spot. The Western
                language surrounding these concepts have also slowly calcified to perpetuate these concepts, allowing
                this ‘lock-in technology’ to be airtight to the average phone user.</p>

            <p>What would a more holistic, culturally sensitive understanding of time and space look like? Language,
                throughout history, has carried cultural temporal and spatial understandings and philosophies. Could we
                use non-Western language as an investigative tool to understand the personal connections and
                navigational and temporal techniques that an individual could use to understand their environment?</p>

            <p>This project explores the intersection of cognitive mapping, temporal navigation, and environmental
                interaction, through the creation of four distinct maps. The maps progressively layer <em>solar</em>,
                <em>meteorological</em>, <em>celestial</em>, and <em>sensory data</em> to create a dynamic
                representation of how the environment shapes human perception of space and time.
            </p>

            <p>They are meant to serve as an atlas, as a point of reference, and as a dictionary to expand our
                understanding of time and space.</p>

            <p>While the politics of time and space have affected the language we use to describe them, dictionaries of
                the environment created in barren landscapes have evaded those influences, and might be the key to
                rehabilitating the autonomy over your own sense of time and space.</p>

            <p>The logic behind the overlaying of the maps, which are designed around words and language, is to reassign
                temporal and spatial autonomy to the individual.</p>
