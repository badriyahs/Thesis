                        the west. This connotation reflects the balance and eventual tipping of the sun as it
                        transitions into its setting phase.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>barah</strong> captures movement indirectly by
                        focusing on the empty space or negative space left behind. It functions through connotation
                        rather than direct denotation, evoking the movement of the sun not by describing the sun itself
                        but by metonymically (or by association) referencing the empty space left behind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal and Spatial Connotation:</strong> When applied to the sun,
                        <strong>barah</strong> implies its forward motion or departure through spatial semantics,
                        embodying the sense of movement through absence. So the word has a spatial quality. It isn’t any
                        specific point in the sky from my understanding.

                        <strong>Notes:</strong> Colloquially in everyday Arabic, it is an open, empty area. Perhaps an

                        It alludes to the sun's intense heat, particularly as it sets in the west, transitioning into a
                        deep red or black hue.
                        It encapsulates both the intense strength of the sun and the symbolic closing of the day, as if

                        It describes the

                        and orientation, signifying the general direction of the East. It encapsulates the sun's rising
                        motion from the
                        ground up, reinforcing its connection to cyclical beginnings and its spherical connotation. The

                        the idea of renewal and the start of a new temporal cycle, marking dawn as a crucial spatial and
                        temporal event.
                        It also applies to the moon and stars, reflecting the shared behavior of celestial bodies in the

                        particularly during summer, when its sharp heat and brightness feel overwhelming and direct. It
                        symbolizes the
                        connection between the body and the sun's position, with the sensation of heat striking the head

                        anchor to the celestial body's dominance in the middle of the day. This placement emphasizes the

                        presence, linking it
                        to the sharpness and intensity of high summer. This sharpness is not just physical but also
                        symbolic, representing
                        the height of the sun's influence over the Earth. The reference to snow and freezing cold adds a

                        suggests a dynamic relationship between light and surface, where the location of light provides
                        clues to the
                        sun’s position in the sky. It connotes a sense of connection between the celestial and the

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> Ain means "eye," symbolizing vision and perception. It also refers
                        to a source of
                        water, such as a spring, known as the "eye of water." This dual meaning connects the term to

                        seeing and the life-giving properties of water.

                        <strong>Temporal and Spatial Connotation:</strong> In the context of the sun, Ain suggests the

                        illumination that comes from vision, much like the sun's rays allowing the act of seeing. The
                        reference to water
                        ties the sun to life and renewal, as both are essential for existence. Ain also embodies the
                        concept of the sun
                        as a source, whether of light, warmth, or the rhythm of the day. Spatially, it captures the idea
                        of pinpointing
                        focus, much like an eye, while temporally, it links to the sun as a guide that marks the

                        of light, life, and growth. Just as the sun sustains life through its rays, a spring provides
                        nourishment. This
                        symbolism enriches Ain as a concept, aligning it with both sight and sustenance, tying the

                        has alluded to the roundness of the Earth. In older texts, including the Quran, the term for the

                        This concept reflects a deep understanding of the elliptical solar path, where the sun’s rise is
                        seen as a continuous journey rather than a singular event. The idea also highlights an ancient
                        recognition of the Earth’s roundness, as it was never perceived as flat, likely due to the Arab
                        connection to the sky and celestial observations.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Gharab</strong> is the colloquial and most commonly used
                        word for "west," but when used for the sun, it specifically refers to the setting sun. It can
                        also apply to the setting of other celestial objects, such as the stars or the moon.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal and Spatial Connotation:</strong> The astronomical definition of
                        <strong>gharab</strong> is extensive, describing the sun's position relative to the tropics. In
                        summer, it is associated with the sun at the Tropic of Cancer for 28 nights, extending to the
                        rising point of the star <strong>Semak al-Rameh</strong> (Arcturus). In winter, it refers to the
                        sun at the Tropic of Capricorn for 28 days. Between these extremes, 180 sunsets mark the
                        transitions.
                        <br><br>
                        In a religious context, <strong>gharab</strong> is described as the final point the sun is
                        destined to arrive at, emphasizing its continuous movement. It does not imply stopping or
                        slowing but rather portrays the sun as a traveler, moving with purpose along a line until the
                        end of existence.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Qaran</strong> means "horn," often used for animals or the
                        top of something, similar to how "crown" is used in English, such as the horn of a mountain.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal and Spatial Connotation:</strong> In reference to the sun,
                        <strong>qaran</strong> signifies the first ray of light that appears at sunrise or the moment
                        when the top of the sun becomes visible as sunrise begins. It alludes to the sun’s presence
                        through its extension—a ray—marking a specific temporal event tied to the start of the day.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Qasab</strong> refers to the tough, dry type of dates that
                        are very sweet and sugary, often breaking apart due to their dryness. It can also mean a tough,
                        hard stem in plants, such as <strong>qasab al-sukar</strong> (the "qasab of sugar"), referring
                        to sugarcane.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        Another form of the word, <strong>qaseeb</strong>, relates to the sound of running water, which
                        is intense and somewhat associated with the toughness and intensity of sugarcane, though not
                        directly.

                        <strong>qasab</strong> describes its motion toward the west at sunset. It implies a movement
                        that seems to escape the eye—visible only in peripheral vision. It is akin to how the sound of
                        running water is a peripheral effect of the actual motion of the water itself.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Qanab</strong> refers to a lion’s claw, specifically the

                        visible. The term carries a connotation of the sun’s harshness being temporarily subdued as it
                        is concealed and protected, with the understanding that it will inevitably rise again.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Kasaf</strong> or <strong>Kusoof</strong> refers to when
                        light goes away, turning into darkness. Colloquially, it is used for eclipses, with
                        <strong>Kusoof</strong> typically referring to the sun and <strong>Khusoof</strong> referring to
                        the moon. The modern consensus differentiates these terms linguistically, though both are valid.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal and Spatial Connotation:</strong> <strong>Kusoof</strong> implies an

                        emphasizes an abrupt transition, such as an eclipse.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>La’ab</strong> translates to "saliva," but in Arabic, it
                        lacks the negative connotation it might carry in English. Instead, it refers to liquid
                        secretion, often from the mouth. Its meaning shifts based on context, such as <strong>lu’ab
                            alnahal</strong> ("saliva of the bees") referring to honey, or <strong>lu’ab
                            aljarad</strong> ("saliva of the insect") referring to poison. In relation to the sun,
                        <strong>lu’ab alshams</strong> ("saliva of the sun") describes a ray resembling a thread,

                        the intense heat when the air is still, with rays becoming visibly distinct. It can evoke visual
                        phenomena such as cobweb-like distortions caused by extreme heat, though it is distinct from a
                        mirage, which is associated with the ground, not the sun.
