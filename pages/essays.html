                    Foucault states:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history: with its themes of
                    development and of suspension, of crisis, and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its
                    great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world. The nineteenth century
                    found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermodynamics. The present
                    epoch will perhaps be above all the epoch of space. We are in the epoch of simultaneity: we are in
                    the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed. We
                    are at a moment, I believe, when our experience of the world is less that of a long life developing
                    through time than that of a network that connects points and intersects with its own skein."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    So Foucault talks about the cognitive progression of space:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Medieval Space - Space as Emplacement</h3>
                <p>
                    In the medieval era, space was hierarchal, chosen, and divinely ordained. People lived where they
                    did because it was believed to be chosen by God. This perpetuated a hierarchical power system: a
                    royal or pope was ordained by God, while a farmer was also divinely assigned their position.
                    Breaking out of these roles was seen as blasphemous.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Galileo - Space as Extension</h3>
                <p>
                    Galileo's era introduced the idea of space as extension—a thing’s place being where it is now,
                    subject to change. His heliocentric model unsettled the medieval notion of emplacement, replacing it
                    with the concept of infinite, open space. A thing's position became defined by its current spot and
                    its movement. This was deeply offensive to the Church as it challenged the notion of Earth—and
                    humanity—being chosen by God. Religion had to adapt to accommodate this paradigm shift.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Contemporary - Space as Site</h3>
                <p>
                    Today’s understanding of space focuses on its relational properties. Space is defined by its
                    relationships—proximity, interaction, and roles. This view of space reflects a broader understanding
                    of relativity: identity, history, and geography are all studied through their connections to other
                    things. No longer defined by divine path or personal history, space is now understood through roles
                    and relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This shift invites reconsideration of how we understand space. It can encourage architects,
                    planners, and analysts to justify decisions through Foucault’s narrative. However, this perspective
                    is limiting because it often reflects only Eurocentric histories. For example, how did Arabs
                    navigating barren deserts understand space? Their geometry would be celestial, not terrestrial,
                    relying on the sky to map and orient themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This raises the question: can Foucault’s model be applied to non-Western contexts? In barren
                    landscapes like deserts, plains, or seas, navigation depends on larger-scale celestial or
                    meteorological maps. These landscapes demand a different psychology of wayfinding and timetelling,
                    where shifting projections, not linear landmarks, define space.
                </p>

                <h3>Time and Space</h3>
                <p>
                    Foucault also touches on the interplay between time and space:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Time probably appears to us only as one of the various distributive operations that are possible
                    for the elements that are spread out in space."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This raises another important point: how time and space are understood and represented depends on
                    cultural contexts. Western interpretations often detach the sacred from time and space, reducing
                    them to measurable constructs. However, non-Western traditions often embed sacredness in their
                    understanding, blending time, space, and the divine seamlessly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, applying Foucault’s model universally risks erasing diverse ways of understanding space
                    and time. Landscapes like deserts, oceans, and plains offer alternative psychologies and geometries
                    of orientation that deserve exploration. These perspectives enrich our understanding of humanity’s
                    interaction with the environment, offering lenses that are “strange” yet beautiful in their
                    divergence from Western norms.

                <p>
                    The blind spot of science, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting, but also most dangerous,
                    aspects of everything that we know. We categorize, place into boxes, into labels, and this is
                    something we must do to advance science. There really is no other way to do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, while this process is necessary, it is also necessary that we must not forget what we’ve
                    taken as fact. We constantly make the error of mistaking the name of the thing for what it really
                    is.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Wittgenstein, in his famous <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> (1921), states, "Nothing in the
                    visual field allows you to infer that it is seen by an eye."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The eye is the invisible condition of seeing. In the same vein, the knower is the invisible
                    condition of knowing. The tool is the invisible condition of the observation. The clock is the
                    invisible condition of time. The map is the invisible condition of (space?) (orientation?).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the history of knowledge, I do think there are specific points in which the tool, what will soon
                    become invisible, is clearly there right before it vanishes. For example, Galileo Galilei
                    mathematized natural phenomena. He put a quantifiable scientific method (which was taught to him by
                    Vincenzo Galilei, his father) to what we previously attributed to God’s unquestionable handiwork. By
                    doing this, he created something tangible for us to compute and dispute, and therein lies his
                    genius. However, by doing this, he also squeezes reality into boxes of ideal variables. Everything
                    became only valid when it could either fit or equal to or create these ideal boxes. This allowed
                    more and more sciences to advance and become more robust, and slowly built a foundation upon which
                    more knowledge could be built. The foundation grows higher and higher, with much less teetering,
                    because of the rigidity of those boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, what comes after this is a world of scientists who are mistaking the ideal, quantifiable
                    version of the phenomena to be the phenomena itself. Science grows more and more efficient, more
                    robust, more prolific, the better the quantities fit into each other, but also, a large part of the
                    phenomena being studied gets lost, and the human connection to the phenomena becomes untethered and
                    disoriented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objectivity is a way to advance the science, but let’s be aware that it cannot really be truly
                    objective. Whatever the phenomena is, is bent, skewed, slightly shaved, because of what is used to
                    measure it or understand it. Of course! Can we really be so self-absorbed to believe our limited
                    mathematical tools, or our digital representations, can measure the movement of heavenly bodies? How
                    can we trust our devices as much as we do? How can we trust cameras? Maps? Limitations are the
                    condition of understanding. So we cannot see anything outside of the blind spots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, what we can do, and what we should do, is examine the blind spots as well as we can. Let’s
                    go back to Wittgenstein’s "Nothing in the visual field allows you to infer that it is seen by an
                    eye." I disagree with this, as do many others. There is a way to infer that it is seen by an eye.
                    You could close your eyes, and everything would turn black, and then you’d know that your eyes are
                    being used. You could observe someone else. You could try seeing with your nose, for example, and
                    then work by the process of elimination to get to your eye. You could look in the mirror and
                    observe. You could ask someone with no eyes at all and ask if they could see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In these ways, you are inferring that you are seeing with your eyes. With other blind spots, could
                    the same thing work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way we’ve structured science is through inductive reasoning, which is an argument that applies
                    the past to the future. We do this to clarify mysteries. We examine life in hindsight, and then try
                    our best to apply it forwards. A forgotten side effect of this wonderful scientific process is that
                    it works so well—it clarifies so much ambiguity—but perhaps too well, where there is no wonder or
                    mystery left at all.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The clock is the invisible condition of time." So let’s examine time by changing the clock.

                    Foreignness created a divide between the reality of the Middle East and its representation in
                    dominating media.
                    Foreignness, when combined with awareness, can be a catalyst to explore new horizons and ways of
                    life without allowing the inevitable bias of the observer to impose upon existing ideas. However,
                    foreignness without awareness can lead to false representations that ultimately impose themselves on
                    the studied subject. These false representations materialize into harmful practices in building,
                    economy, or dealing with the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of colonizing countries in the Middle East, Western forces failed to acknowledge their
                    own biases, instead seeing them as truth. They evaluated the practices, culture, and environment
                    they encountered based on Western standards. For example, when observing the Arabian desert, the
                    colors, textures, and nature of the scenery were judged through a Western lens of environmental
                    health. Beige tones, high temperatures, and the scarcity of water are natural to this landscape.
                    However, when perceived by a European onlooker, it might evoke a dead or burned landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The false idea of the Middle East being overgrazed, parched, or unlivable is what Davis refers to as
                    an “environmental imaginary.” This, in itself, is not yet problematic. Observations come from
                    schemas—previous knowledge of certain things—which allow us to make connections. These can be
                    reframed or built upon. The issue arises with the next step. Instead of allowing these notions to
                    propel fruitful research, they materialized into invasive actions aimed at “rehabilitating” the
                    land, with the intention of “improving” or “saving” the “dying” landscape. Of course, this was not a
                    humanitarian effort; it was thinly veiled imperialism.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “The consequent need to ‘improve,’ ‘restore,’ ‘normalize,’ or ‘repair’ the environment provided
                    powerful justifications for innumerable imperial projects, from building irrigation systems to
                    reforestation activities to the bombing of ‘unruly’ tribes to the sedentarization of nomads as a
                    measure to prevent ‘overgrazing.’ … Determined to boost production of economically profitable crops
                    such as cotton, a great deal of energy and resources was spent on dams, canals, and other
                    technologies to improve and spread irrigation infrastructures in most of the Middle East and North
                    Africa.” (Davis, 2011)

                    Al Ula is a new, popular site for internal tourism in Saudi Arabia. Before this, the “city of Al
                    Ula” was a small Bedouin agricultural town. These are unofficial descriptions based on personal
                    experience, so the vocabulary may be poorly translated. The “city” part could be driven through in
                    ten minutes, and it seemed to have the necessities. There were no international franchises or malls.
                    The only recognizable logo was a Dunkin’ Donuts truck (not even a café) that appeared only in
                    winter.

                    imposed environmental imaginaries were not just a case of miscommunication leading to imposed ideas,
                    but also a misunderstanding in how ideas are documented and shared from the outset.

                <p>
                    Two thousand years before Ptolemy wrote <em>Almagest</em>, or his famed astronomical atlas, the
                    Arabs had already perfected the science and mathematics of astronomy. They used the stars to tell
                    time in terms of seasons, then months, then days, hours, and for experts, down to the minute. They
                    also used the stars for navigation, with precision that could reach up to 50 cm (as described by an
                    astronomer I learned from).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the Arabs delved deeper into astronomy than any other civilization in history. Yet, today,
                    astronomy is attributed to the Ancient Greeks, even though their knowledge was preceded and later
                    built upon by the Arabs. We can see clues of this today: 41% of the scientific names of the stars
                    are Arabic, while the remaining 59% are divided among other languages. Stars like Al-Debaran,
                    Al-Rigel (Orion’s foot), and Al-Tair are official scientific names, clearly Arabic. These names were
                    recorded only when other civilizations, such as the Persians, requested translations. For 2,000
                    years, no one wrote down the precise science of the stars until it was necessary for translation.
                    When this knowledge reached the Greek civilizations, it was organized into books by astronomers like
                    Ptolemy. When these books returned to the Arabs, they were expanded upon and corrected.

                <p>
                    Take the astrolabe. The dimensions and mechanisms of the astrolabe were passed down orally through
                    poetry in the Arab world. Entire families were dedicated to the craft (like the family of Mariam
                    Al-Astrulabiyya). The Greeks made their astrolabes using these rules. The Greek astrolabe had one
                    level of precision, or one piece of metal used to find the angle of the stars relative to the
                    horizon. The Arabs took this tool and added ten pieces of metal, or ten levels of precision. These
                    histories are well documented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The word “documented” implies an organized encyclopedia of facts that can be referenced. However,
                    these histories were documented through poetry and oral tradition. Initially, I was skeptical of
                    this. Stories can easily become distorted without proper referencing. But the astronomer who
                    explained this to me asked me to approach random people and ask about the stars. In one of my first
                    encounters, an otherwise unremarkable, “uneducated” bus driver shocked me by reciting poetry—a
                    scientific observation of a star and its use in forecasting the weather. He even mentioned that he
                    navigated using the stars, something I eventually had to learn as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, misunderstandings between native Arabs and colonizers could be addressed similarly. The
                    issue was not a literal misunderstanding due to a language barrier, but a fundamental
                    misunderstanding of how information is transmitted and built upon. Speaking in tongues in London,
                    for example, could be seen as either witchcraft or a humorous Shakespearean performance. However, in
                    Al Ula, speaking through poetry, telling time in verse, or discussing precise sciences and
                    mathematics using romantic language is the norm. The divorce between science and art is not an Arab
                    idea. They peacefully coexisted before Western rational thought forcibly separated the two, leaving
                    both incomplete and supporting the imaginary portrayal of an uneducated, unaware Arab who ruined his
                    environment and needed to be rehabilitated and taught how to live “correctly.” The information that
                    explains the Arab way of life is readily available, but it is misunderstood as unscientific or
                    unreliable because it is not evaluated based on the original standards. Instead, it is evaluated by
                    a foreign observer, leading to severe misinterpretations.

                    I will say that the tilt of the summer vs. winter axes is not accurate to how the sun actually
                    “moves” astronomically; the arcs are not at a tilt, they are at a displacement. But I made them tilt
                    because that’s how it seems from our vantage point on Earth, and the way things seem to be is much
                    more important to understand than how they actually are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a point to be made behind why this map tracks the sun based on our imagination or our
                    experience when there exists a scientifically accurate, legible model of the sun used in
                    architectural engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern astronomy—what we see in scientific illustrations that depict the accurate and mathematical
                    paths and trajectories of the cosmos—is not a reflection of our direct human experience. They do not
                    even occur on our scale. They are not based on our sight, our natural sense of space, our natural
                    sense of movement. So it comes as no surprise that we are completely divorced from our surroundings
                    and rely on a satellite’s sense of time and space. What am I supposed to do with the fact that the
                    sun is in the center? Or if the Earth is in the center?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure, modern astronomy is the truth, but it must be refitted into our intuitive understanding of the
                    world. In modern astronomy, our earlier concepts of the world are looked down upon—even laughed at.
                    Haha, how could they really think the Earth was flat? Or that the sun rotated around the Earth? What
                    idiots! That’s like astronomy 101!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But they operated based on intuition, and the feeling of being centered, and seeing the sun travel
                    from East to West was a clear reflection of the direct human experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of this argument is not to deny modern research, only to put it in perspective.

                <h3>Milestones in the History of Astronomy</h3>
                <p>
                    To contextualize this, let’s look at some milestones in the history of astronomy. The Greeks
                    persisted in the Earth-centered view even after scientists like Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310–264 BC)
                    declared it was the Earth moving around the sun because the Greeks felt like man was connected to
                    the universe and at the center of it, placed there by God. The Church backed this because it was
                    beneficial for them to adhere to the philosophy of humans being “chosen” somehow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, the Copernican revolution. It brought science into the humanities. However, the mechanics of
                    the cosmos are not the only way to see reality. They do not make up all of human nature, or history,
                    or cognition. If for thousands and thousands of years, everything we knew and know came from the
                    sky, what sky was it? It certainly wasn’t the sky drawn by satellites but the sky that we saw and
                    understood with our eyes. So to understand the way we think, we have to see that sky again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What’s interesting is that sun-centered and Earth-centered models don’t actually contradict each
                    other. They are two sides of the same coin because they both had to arrive at the same
                    conclusions—that the sun makes the day and the absence of it makes the night, and everything else
                    relies on that. The two ways of thought: one determined by technology and an accurate God-view
                    model, and the other by direct human experience.
                </p>
                <h3>A Broadway Metaphor</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine you attend a Broadway show, a depiction of Romeo and Juliet. You’re deeply moved by this
                    show, even brought to tears. The play affects your life profoundly. You find yourself amazed by the
                    real effect it had on your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will that effect change if, a month later, you decided to follow the actors backstage and inquired
                    about their real lives? Would it be of any benefit to you to know the actors don’t have any romantic
                    chemistry offstage? That ‘Juliet’ is actually married to someone else—that she’s older than ‘Romeo,’
                    and that she actually looks down on him as an actor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would that change the effect, the wonder, the sparkle you had in your eyes the first time you saw
                    it? Would it change any of the epiphanies you had in your own life or the way the story played out?
                </p>
                <h3>The Importance of Intuition</h3>
                <p>
                    The way humans untangled the mysteries and patterns of the sky, the way they drew their culture from
                    it, their mathematics, their language, their psychology, their travel, their daily lives, and the
                    way it played into their folklore, was the blueprint to everything we know today. The way we’ve
                    drawn time into years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes. The way we know the compass, latitude,
                    longitude, the way we’ve made our devices, the way we imagine scale, and science, and religion, all
                    came from the stories that we wove from the sky. To push all that aside and replace it in schools
                    with modern astronomy leaves a huge gap in human understanding. Let’s not write it off because of
                    its mathematical inconsistencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, the point is that these maps aren’t meant to take you away from technology—of course, we
                    need Google Maps and the time dictated by Greenwich—but they are meant to put it all into context.
