                This project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                How can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it? how can we reframe computation as a tool to explore history, not erase it?
            </p>
            <p>
                below are the project details, as explained in the propose review: </p>

                    <summary>What is "Resistant Temporalities"?</summary>
                    <p>
                        "Resistant Temporalities" is a critical computation project that reexamines how we perceive and
                        interact with
                        time and space—how we read light, shadow, directions, and the environment around us. Over time,
                        standardized
                        systems have imposed a systematic, one-size-fits-all temporal and spatial experience. Clocks and
                        calendars
                        dictate time, leaving us blind to qualitative, holistic ways of understanding our surroundings.
                        What if we
                        could reclaim time as something experienced and created through our perception of the sun, the
                        moon, the
                        stars, and the clouds?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humans have historically engaged with their environment to navigate and make sense of the world.
                        Time was once
                        an open-source project: the sun, stars, moon, shadows, and even the movement of water or sand
                        communicated
                        precise temporal and spatial meanings. These systems are unchanged; the stars still move 15
                        degrees per hour,
                        the moon cycles through its phases, and the sun’s path remains constant. What has changed is our
                        exposure to
                        and awareness of these natural systems, replaced by imposed structures like digital clocks and
                        satellite-based
                        maps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, time is treated as an unbreakable, linear construct—constant, unquestionable, and
                        dictated in units like
                        minutes and hours. Space is similarly reduced to abstractions in maps, detached from lived,
                        tactile
                        experiences. These constructs, presented as neutral, are deeply political tools that flatten
                        temporal and
                        spatial diversity into a single, Westernized framework. They are “lock-in technologies,”
                        calcifying a
                        monoculture that undermines localized knowledge and disempowers individuals from perceiving time
                        and space on
                        their own terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What would a more holistic, culturally sensitive understanding of time and space look like?
                        Language, throughout
                        history, has carried rich cultural philosophies tied to time and space. Could non-Western
                        frameworks help us
                        rediscover navigational and temporal techniques and reclaim our connection to the environment?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project explores these questions through four distinct maps that layer solar,
                        meteorological, celestial,
                        and sensory data. These maps offer a dynamic representation of how the environment shapes human
                        perception of
                        time and space. They are intended to serve as an atlas, a point of reference, and a dictionary,
                        expanding our
                        understanding of temporal and spatial autonomy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logic behind these maps, designed around words and language, challenges the imposed
                        monoculture of digital
                        time and space. By returning to first-hand environmental observation and culturally embedded
                        knowledge
                        systems—like dictionaries of the environment created in barren landscapes—we can begin to
                        rehabilitate
                        autonomy over our temporal and spatial experiences.

                    <summary>Computational Methods</summary>
                    <p>
                        The computational methods I am using include mathematical graphing and parametric modeling of
                        solar information,
                        such as sun paths. I purposely apply parametric, quantitative measurements to a literary and
                        qualitative subject,
                        even though it may struggle to fit. This is to critique the homogenization of how we typically
                        quantitatively measure
                        the sun. In doing so, I critique the homogenization of environmental computation using the same
                        metrics that are
                        already being employed. My aim is to describe more nuanced and qualitative ways of experiencing
                        time and space
                        within these same frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of the index and parametric framework is repeated for the clouds and will extend to the
                        stars and moon,
                        ensuring that all the research relies on code and representational software. Parametricism is
                        central to my
                        project because it situates it within existing computational practices. This approach makes the
                        work replicable
                        and adaptable, allowing it to function as a case study for integrating other non-Western sources
                        of environmental
                        knowledge into broader frameworks—not just my chosen subject, the Arabic dictionaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also incorporated machine learning and image classification to further explore environmental
                        phenomena and plan
                        to expand my use of computational methods as the project develops. Peripheral tools include
                        website building, data
                        visualization, and Arduino coding. These tools enhance accessibility and interactivity, serving
                        as prototypes to
                        test out these approaches.

                    <summary>Design methodology:</summary>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Critical</strong> - I am critiquing the ways digitization has flattened time and space,
                        and I'm critiquing our blind acceptance of this way of living. We're so incredibly dependent on
                        a dictated time, and we are (intentionally) oblivious to the fact that time is constructed,
                        dictated, and deeply politicized. It's not just about time being measured but about how those
                        measurements shape our reality, disconnecting us from more intuitive, lived experiences. This
                        critique is not meant to reject technology outright but to confront how its unchecked dominance
                        homogenizes and erases alternative ways of understanding the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>It is also experimental and narrative.</strong> I’m building a framework that could
                        apply to any science or system flattened by technology. Alternate ways of seeing the world are
                        usually so pervasive and ingrained that it feels almost impossible to imagine integrating them
                        into the lives we live now. Technology is like a god—it exists in everything, shaping how we
                        move, think, and experience the world. But to blindly rely on it as the <em>only</em> way to
                        live is a choice we've made, not an inevitability. I’m trying to challenge that by offering a
                        tool and platform that reintroduces alternative perspectives into the computational framework—an
                        attack from the inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its core, this project is about reclaiming agency. It’s about asking: how can we disrupt the
                        systems that dictate the way we understand time and space without losing the benefits of modern
                        tools? How can we balance the precision of computation with the richness of human perception?
                        It’s an experiment in resisting erasure, a story about reframing technology as a collaborator
                        rather than a dictator.

                            Star and horizon. Its simplicity embodies a computational idea.

                            hemispheres, on which magnets draw the main stars and constellations visible respectively
                            from the southern and northern hemispheres. Each disk can rotate on itself, while a sensor
                            arm, like an old vinyl needle, ‘reads’ the magnets—or rather, ‘reads the stars’ of the known
                            universe. In this way, it can send sound signals to the public.”

                            to exist in random pockets of the internet, but here are some examples without captions:

                            <strong>B.W. Betts</strong>
                            I’ve always been obsessed with the drawings of B.W. Betts. Published posthumously by his
                            wife, these drawings—called "Geometrical Psychology"—are Betts’ interpretation of what it
                            would be like to map the psyche. He creates an underlying mathematics, with proofs and
                            conjectures to support these intricate graphs.

                        <strong>Kitab Al-Anwaa</strong> by Qutaiba Al-Dinuri (9th century) – This text serves as a key
                        source, providing rich linguistic and cultural insights into environmental phenomena, including
                        temporal and spatial frameworks derived from natural observations. However, the organization and
                        indexing of the data are entirely based on my own interpretation.
