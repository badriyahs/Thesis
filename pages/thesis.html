                This project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                How can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it?

                    <p>
                        "Resistant Temporalities" is a project that explores alternative ways of
                        understanding and experiencing time. It critiques the linear, imperial,
                        and politicized nature of time, especially the role computation has played in homogenizing
                        time even further, and proposes ways to rehabilitate a more independent
                        temporal experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This exploration isn't just theoretical—it is meant to inspire practical approaches for
                        reimagining and reclaiming our relationship with time, rooted in autonomy and personal
                        experience.

                    <p>
                        "Resistant Temporalities" is a critical computation project that reexamines how we perceive and
                        interact with
                        time and space—how we read light, shadow, directions, and the environment around us. Over time,
                        standardized
                        systems have imposed a systematic, one-size-fits-all temporal and spatial experience. Clocks and
                        calendars
                        dictate time, leaving us blind to qualitative, holistic ways of understanding our surroundings.
                        What if we
                        could reclaim time as something experienced and created through our perception of the sun, the
                        moon, the
                        stars, and the clouds?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humans have historically engaged with their environment to navigate and make sense of the world.
                        Time was once
                        an open-source project: the sun, stars, moon, shadows, and even the movement of water or sand
                        communicated
                        precise temporal and spatial meanings. These systems are unchanged; the stars still move 15
                        degrees per hour,
                        the moon cycles through its phases, and the sun’s path remains constant. What has changed is our
                        exposure to
                        and awareness of these natural systems, replaced by imposed structures like digital clocks and
                        satellite-based
                        maps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, time is treated as an unbreakable, linear construct—constant, unquestionable, and
                        dictated in units like
                        minutes and hours. Space is similarly reduced to abstractions in maps, detached from lived,
                        tactile
                        experiences. These constructs, presented as neutral, are deeply political tools that flatten
                        temporal and
                        spatial diversity into a single, Westernized framework. They are “lock-in technologies,”
                        calcifying a
                        monoculture that undermines localized knowledge and disempowers individuals from perceiving time
                        and space on
                        their own terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What would a more holistic, culturally sensitive understanding of time and space look like?
                        Language, throughout
                        history, has carried rich cultural philosophies tied to time and space. Could non-Western
                        frameworks help us
                        rediscover navigational and temporal techniques and reclaim our connection to the environment?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project explores these questions through four distinct maps that layer solar,
                        meteorological, celestial,
                        and sensory data. These maps offer a dynamic representation of how the environment shapes human
                        perception of
                        time and space. They are intended to serve as an atlas, a point of reference, and a dictionary,
                        expanding our
                        understanding of temporal and spatial autonomy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logic behind these maps, designed around words and language, challenges the imposed
                        monoculture of digital
                        time and space. By returning to first-hand environmental observation and culturally embedded
                        knowledge
                        systems—like dictionaries of the environment created in barren landscapes—we can begin to
                        rehabilitate
                        autonomy over our temporal and spatial experiences.

                    <summary>Computational Methods</summary>
                    <p>
                        The computational methods I am using include mathematical graphing and parametric modeling of
                        solar information,
                        such as sun paths. I purposely apply parametric, quantitative measurements to a literary and
                        qualitative subject,
                        even though it may struggle to fit. This is to critique the homogenization of how we typically
                        quantitatively measure
                        the sun. In doing so, I critique the homogenization of environmental computation using the same
                        metrics that are
                        already being employed. My aim is to describe more nuanced and qualitative ways of experiencing
                        time and space
                        within these same frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of the index and parametric framework is repeated for the clouds and will extend to the
                        stars and moon,
                        ensuring that all the research relies on code and representational software. Parametricism is
                        central to my
                        project because it situates it within existing computational practices. This approach makes the
                        work replicable
                        and adaptable, allowing it to function as a case study for integrating other non-Western sources
                        of environmental
                        knowledge into broader frameworks—not just my chosen subject, the Arabic dictionaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also incorporated machine learning and image classification to further explore environmental
                        phenomena and plan
                        to expand my use of computational methods as the project develops. Peripheral tools include
                        website building, data
                        visualization, and Arduino coding. These tools enhance accessibility and interactivity, serving
                        as prototypes to
                        test out these approaches.
