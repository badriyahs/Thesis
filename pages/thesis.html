                This project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                How can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it?

                    <p class="answer">"Resistant Temporalities" is a project that explores alternative ways of
                        understanding and experiencing time ways of understanding and experiencing time. It critiques
                        the linear, imperial,
                        and politicized nature of time and offers ways to reclaim it through connection with nature
                        and ancient time-keeping methods.</p>

                    <summary>What is the purpose of the maps in this project?</summary>
                    <p class="answer">The maps in the project are a visual representation of the interconnectedness
                        of time, space, and nature. They challenge the conventional use of maps as mere geographical
                        representations and propose an alternative way to understand our place in the world through
                        time.</p>

                    <summary>How does the project challenge the idea of time?</summary>
                    <p class="answer">The project challenges the conventional understanding of time as something linear
                        and imperial by proposing a more fluid, cyclical, and natural approach to time, rooted in
                        ancient
                        ways of perceiving time through the movements of the sun, stars, and natural phenomena.</p>

                The thesis delves into:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How different cultures perceive and utilize time.</li>
                <li>The interplay between subjective and objective time.</li>
                <li>Strategies for cultivating an intimate relationship with temporal realities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This exploration isn't just theoreticalâ€”it is meant to inspire practical approaches for reimagining
                and reclaiming our relationship with time, rooted in autonomy and personal experience.
