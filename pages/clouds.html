                Clouds, a dynamic and changing aspect of our environment, have been key to human perception of time,
                weather, and space. This page explores how clouds have been represented through various cultural and
                linguistic lenses, each linked to different temporal and spatial meanings.

                    <h3 class="card-title">1. Bakhar</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Bakhar</strong> refers to steam, specifically
                        evaporated
                        water coming off hot surfaces. It is colloquially used to describe clouds that appear above
                        the
                        sea, known as "Banat Bakhr" (daughters of Bakhar), which are delicate and float above the
                        sea,
                        not seen above land. The term “Banat Bakhr” refers to these clouds, which are white and vary
                        in
                        size. They appear before the summer. <br>
                        <br>
                        The word "Makhr" (also used to describe when a ship slices through the water, creating foam
                        and
                        movement) evokes the imagery of the motion, sound, and feeling of the ship's slicing through
                        water, with the resulting foam. This concept could metaphorically tie these clouds to the
                        idea
                        of being born from the foam, floating above the sea as if they were a result of this
                        movement.
                        However, they may not be directly related; for poetic satisfaction, let’s say they are.

                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Appears before summer, signaling the transition to warmer

                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> Associated with the sea (Banat Bakhr) and not seen above

                        <strong>Notes:</strong> *Bakhar* clouds evoke the imagery of a ship's motion through water,
                        the
                        foam, and the gentle power of nature. They symbolize the growth of summer, the dynamic
                        presence
                        of nature’s forces, and the quiet strength before the heat of the season.

                        <strong>Cumulus (Cu):</strong> These clouds are billowy, large, and puffed, similar to
                        *Bakhar*.
                        Cumulus clouds symbolize growth, transition, and an increasing presence in the sky.<br>
                        <strong>Cumulonimbus (Cb):</strong> These towering clouds can mirror the strength of
                        *Makhr*,
                        representing an imposing presence that signals the transformation of atmospheric conditions,
                        much like the movement and intensity suggested by the "slicing" motion of the ship.

                    <h3 class="card-title">2. Tara’</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Tara’</strong> means to become full. It is used for bowls
                        or basins, to become full to the brim with liquid. The term is also used for valleys, lakes,
                        rivers, etc., meaning they are full and about to spill — in the sense that if the valley is
                        full, there is a flood coming. <br><br>
                        Therefore, <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong> refers to a cloud that is full to the brim with
                        water, symbolizing a cloud that is either raining or about to rain. It evokes the image of an
                        impending storm or downpour, with the cloud holding an abundant amount of moisture ready to
                        release.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Used to represent clouds full of rain or rain about to
                        fall, symbolizing a shift in time (seasons or passing time).
                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> No specific spatial connotation mentioned.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong> clouds symbolize the potential for
                        release and transformation. They embody the building pressure that leads to a storm or downpour,
                        reflecting the dynamic nature of weather and the cyclical process of water in nature.

                        <strong>Nimbostratus (Ns):</strong> These clouds are characterized by their dense, heavy nature,
                        often bringing rain or snow. They are a direct representation of a cloud that is full and about
                        to release precipitation, much like <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong>.<br>
                        <strong>Cumulonimbus (Cb):</strong> These clouds are towering and massive, often associated with
                        intense storms. They symbolize the overflowing, dramatic nature of
                        <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong>, as they are capable of releasing heavy rain and storms, much
                        like a cloud reaching the point of overflow.

                    <h3 class="card-title">3. Jaham</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Jaham</strong> refers to an ignorant or unpleasant person,
                        often associated with a bad attitude or an unappealing facial expression. It is used to describe
                        the harsh, unattractive, or unpleasant aspects of behavior or appearance. <br><br>
                        The term also describes the very edge of darkness, referring to the time of night just before
                        dawn, when it is still fully dark, but the first hints of light have not yet appeared. It
                        signifies the last moments of complete darkness before the break of day, or the first quarter of
                        the night when the night feels most oppressive. <br><br>
                        In the context of clouds, <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> refers to light, weak clouds that hold
                        no water and seem to float aimlessly with the wind. These clouds are seen as lacking substance
                        or purpose, providing no rain or shade. They are metaphorically void of blessings and symbolize
                        the emptiness of a cloud that brings no relief, especially in a harsh desert environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Refers to the time before dawn, the last stage of
                        darkness.
                        <br>

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> clouds evoke a sense of futility, a
                        cloud that lacks substance, purpose, or potential. They embody the feeling of the end of the
                        night before dawn when the world feels stagnant, with no promise of relief or change. The clouds
                        are seen as weak and useless, contributing nothing to the environment.

                        <strong>Cirrostratus (Cs):</strong> These clouds are thin, wispy, and often do not hold any
                        moisture. They are similar to <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> in that they are light and do not
                        bring any rain or shade, offering no relief in harsh conditions.<br>
                        <strong>Stratus (St):</strong> These clouds are flat and featureless, covering the sky in a
                        dull, monotonous layer. Like <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong>, they are associated with a lack of
                        movement, change, or substance, symbolizing a weak presence in the sky that does not bring the
                        expected rain or shade.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Habaa/Hubi</strong> refers to anything that is close to the
                        ground. Colloquially, the term is used to mean crawling, like something crawling on the ground,
                        such as a baby or animal. Historically it was used to describe a camel’s movement when it lowers
                        itself close to the earth. <br><br>
                        The term is poetically used to describe the trace left behind on the ground, similar to how an
                        arrow leaves a long mark on the ground if it misses the target. I have personally heard
                        (although I couldn't find this in the books) that <strong>Hubi</strong> specifically means after
                        a battle when arrow marks are on the ground, and in the case it rains the next day, the
                        battlefield is filled with these long puddles that reflect the sky. That imagery is what the
                        clouds are meant to look like. And they appear low to the ground and stretch across the sky in
                        thin, streak-like sheets. These clouds evoke the imagery of marks or traces left behind on the
                        earth, just as an arrow might leave a trail in the dirt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Often seen before or during minor weather changes,
                        symbolizing the fleeting nature of time.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> No specific spatial connotation mentioned, though evokes
                        the idea of a mark left behind in space.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> These clouds carry a sense of impermanence and fragility. Their
                        streak-like formations evoke the feeling of something that is briefly visible but not permanent,
                        akin to the mark an arrow leaves on the ground as it misses its target.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Haras</strong> refers to fierce dedication and commitment
                        to something, often used to describe a commitment to protect someone. It can also mean a tear in
                        something, like a tear in fabric or a wound in skin. <br><br>
                        In the context of clouds, <strong>Haras</strong> refers to a cloud that is low to the ground,
                        with heavy rain that seems to fall so forcefully it tears into the face of the Earth. These
                        clouds evoke the imagery of a tearing force, with their rain appearing as though it is cutting

                        that can tear through the environment. Their presence suggests an intense moment, akin to a
                        forceful commitment or action.

                        When used for clouds, <strong>Hayar</strong> refers to clouds that do not move with the wind,
                        seemingly stuck in one place, wandering aimlessly. They are unsure of where to go, unable to

                        Interestingly, the term used for a confused or dazed person comes from this description of the

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Khalq</strong> refers to creation or the act of
                        creating. It is still used colloquially today and can also mean someone who is well-balanced,
                        mannered, or beautiful. In terms of texture, it evokes a sense of smoothness and openness, much
                        like a hill or a cloud. Specifically, when applied to a cloud, <strong>Khalq</strong> describes
                        a cloud that appears open, silky, and smooth to the touch, resembling a basin that is waiting to
                        collect rain.

                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> These clouds form as horizontal, expansive layers,
                        appearing smooth and uniform, signaling calm weather before a shift to precipitation.

                        <strong>Khalq</strong>. They are the first indication of weather changes, much like the smooth
                        and open appearance of <strong>Khalq</strong> clouds before precipitation occurs.<br>
                        <strong>Altostratus (As):</strong> <strong>Khalq</strong> clouds share similarities with

                        cover large portions of the sky. These clouds represent a prelude to rain, much like
                        <strong>Khalq</strong>, as they indicate increasing moisture and the potential for further
                        development into more substantial cloud systems.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Khayl</strong> refers to assumption, but when
                        pronounced as <strong>Khayal</strong>, it can mean imagination, dream, or apparition. It can
                        also describe any reflection of appearance, such as a shadow, a reflection in a mirror, or even
                        a loved one, as they can be seen as a reflection of oneself. Colloquially,
                        <strong>Khayl</strong> is often used to describe something beautiful or dreamy.
                        <br><br>
                        In the context of clouds, <strong>Khayl</strong> refers to a cloud that appears to hold rain but
                        does not actually bring it. It carries a conditional meaning: if the cloud does release rain, it
                        is called <strong>Mukhayla</strong>, and if not, it is called <strong>Khulba</strong>. Thus, it
                        captures both the assumption (that rain might come) and the imagination (the cloud's potential).

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> <strong>Khayl</strong> clouds occur in a transitional
                        weather phase where atmospheric conditions suggest the possibility of rain, but the actual
                        precipitation does not occur. These clouds typically form during times of unstable weather,
                        where moisture is present in the air, but not enough for full cloud development or rain.

                        <strong>Dalah</strong> refers to a cloud that appears uneven in movement or formation, as though
                        burdened by the weight of water. The cloud seems to sway or step unevenly, mimicking the slow,
                        heavy gait of an animal carrying a load.

                        These clouds represent a transition toward precipitation, where the cloud's weight from the
                        accumulated water affects its appearance and movement.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Dawa</strong> refers to flat, even land, often
                        signifying something in motion, spreading, or rolling out. It is used to describe the movement
                        of sound across flat ground, as sounds made in such environments, like the calls of animals, the
                        buzzing of bees, or thunder, seem to spread in all directions. In the context of clouds,
                        <strong>Dawa</strong> refers to clouds that hold the sound of thunder within them, such as
                        during a storm, where the thunder seems to resonate or carry from the cloud's body.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Rabab</strong> is derived from "Rab," which means
                        God, lord, or the owner of land. When used in this context, <strong>Rabab</strong> refers to a
                        gathering place, such as a city square, where people or even camels come together. The cloud
                        described as <strong>Rabab</strong> governs the rain, collects it, nurtures it, and supports
                        growth. It can be understood as the cloud that nurtures or protects the land, often referred to
                        as the lord of the land, particularly when the clouds are above a farm, village, or area.
                        Additionally, <strong>Rabab</strong> has been used to describe clouds that appear stacked on top
                        of one another, hovering in the center of the sky, giving the illusion of “clouds without
                        clouds.”

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> <strong>Rabab</strong> clouds signify the buildup of
                        moisture in the atmosphere, preparing for potential rain. These clouds often indicate the
                        nurturing stage before precipitation begins, similar to the way they govern and protect the
                        land.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> <strong>Rabab</strong> clouds tend to appear in the center
                        of the sky, forming stacked layers that seem to govern the space above. There is no specific
                        east/west/north/south orientation, but they give the impression of an overarching presence in
                        the sky.

                        <strong>Altostratus (As):</strong> These clouds have a similar featureless, layered appearance
                        to <strong>Rabab</strong> clouds, often covering large portions of the sky, creating a subdued

                        the sky but appear heavy, giving them a sense of swinging or teetering, as though their weight
                        is causing them to lean or shift in the atmosphere.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Ramaa</strong> means to throw, toss, or aim. It
                        can also refer to hunting or shooting. Colloquially, it can mean an animal caught while hunting,
                        like game. When used as a noun, it can describe small arrows used for training, which are thrown
                        without the intention to kill. In the context of clouds, <strong>Ramaa</strong> refers to small,
                        scattered clouds that appear to be tossed about, which will eventually come together to form a
                        larger, rain-bearing cloud.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> <strong>Ramaa</strong> clouds suggest the early stages of
                        cloud formation, where scattered clouds are accumulating and may eventually merge to form more
                        significant, rain-producing clouds.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> These clouds are typically found at low altitudes,
                        scattered across the sky, often appearing to be in motion or displaced, signaling a transitional
                        phase before more significant cloud formations.

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> The word <strong>Rahaa</strong> refers to something that is lax,
                        weak, or flexible. It can also describe a state of negligence or lack of discipline. When
                        describing eyes, <strong>Rahaa</strong> refers to eyes that are downturned or droopy at the
                        edges, often due to age, fatigue, or tiredness. In the context of clouds, <strong>Rahaa</strong>
                        refers to clouds that are relaxed, indifferent, or receptive. These clouds allow rain to move in
                        and out effortlessly, suggesting a sense of weakness, flexibility, or passiveness.

                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> <strong>Rahaa</strong> clouds represent a passive or

                        move freely in and out of the clouds.

                        <strong>Nimbostratus (Ns):</strong> These are featureless, low-level clouds that can allow rain

                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Faraq</strong> colloquially means to separate, diverge, or
                        repel. It can also describe something that branches out or becomes different. The term is also
                        used to refer to a type of camel, called a <strong>fariq</strong>, which wanders off alone to
                        have her child.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> <strong>Faraq</strong> clouds represent clouds that seem
                        to break off from the rest, suggesting a moment of separation or divergence in cloud formations.
                        It may indicate a shift in weather conditions, where a cloud drifts apart from a larger system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> These clouds tend to form in isolated locations, appearing
                        away from larger cloud masses, suggesting their independent nature.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Cloud Types Most Similar To:</strong><br>
                        <strong>Cirrus (Ci):</strong> The wispy, high-altitude nature of <strong>Faraq</strong> clouds
                        shares similarities with <strong>Cirrus</strong> clouds that often appear isolated in the
                        sky.<br>
                        <strong>Cumulus (Cu):</strong> Individual <strong>Cumulus</strong> clouds can sometimes exhibit
                        the same pattern of breaking away from a larger system, similar to the meaning of
                        <strong>Faraq</strong>.
