                Clouds, a dynamic and changing aspect of our environment, have been key to human perception of time,
                weather, and space. This page explores how clouds have been represented through various cultural and
                linguistic lenses, each linked to different temporal and spatial meanings.

                    <h3 class="card-title">1. Bakhar</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Bakhar</strong> refers to steam, specifically
                        evaporated
                        water coming off hot surfaces. It is colloquially used to describe clouds that appear above
                        the
                        sea, known as "Banat Bakhr" (daughters of Bakhar), which are delicate and float above the
                        sea,
                        not seen above land. The term “Banat Bakhr” refers to these clouds, which are white and vary
                        in
                        size. They appear before the summer. <br>
                        <br>
                        The word "Makhr" (also used to describe when a ship slices through the water, creating foam
                        and
                        movement) evokes the imagery of the motion, sound, and feeling of the ship's slicing through
                        water, with the resulting foam. This concept could metaphorically tie these clouds to the
                        idea
                        of being born from the foam, floating above the sea as if they were a result of this
                        movement.
                        However, they may not be directly related; for poetic satisfaction, let’s say they are.

                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Appears before summer, signaling the transition to warmer

                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> Associated with the sea (Banat Bakhr) and not seen above

                        <strong>Notes:</strong> *Bakhar* clouds evoke the imagery of a ship's motion through water,
                        the
                        foam, and the gentle power of nature. They symbolize the growth of summer, the dynamic
                        presence
                        of nature’s forces, and the quiet strength before the heat of the season.

                        <strong>Cumulus (Cu):</strong> These clouds are billowy, large, and puffed, similar to
                        *Bakhar*.
                        Cumulus clouds symbolize growth, transition, and an increasing presence in the sky.<br>
                        <strong>Cumulonimbus (Cb):</strong> These towering clouds can mirror the strength of
                        *Makhr*,
                        representing an imposing presence that signals the transformation of atmospheric conditions,
                        much like the movement and intensity suggested by the "slicing" motion of the ship.

                    <h3 class="card-title">2. Tara’</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Tara’</strong> means to become full. It is used for bowls
                        or basins, to become full to the brim with liquid. The term is also used for valleys, lakes,
                        rivers, etc., meaning they are full and about to spill — in the sense that if the valley is
                        full, there is a flood coming. <br><br>
                        Therefore, <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong> refers to a cloud that is full to the brim with
                        water, symbolizing a cloud that is either raining or about to rain. It evokes the image of an
                        impending storm or downpour, with the cloud holding an abundant amount of moisture ready to
                        release.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Used to represent clouds full of rain or rain about to
                        fall, symbolizing a shift in time (seasons or passing time).
                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> No specific spatial connotation mentioned.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong> clouds symbolize the potential for
                        release and transformation. They embody the building pressure that leads to a storm or downpour,
                        reflecting the dynamic nature of weather and the cyclical process of water in nature.

                        <strong>Nimbostratus (Ns):</strong> These clouds are characterized by their dense, heavy nature,
                        often bringing rain or snow. They are a direct representation of a cloud that is full and about
                        to release precipitation, much like <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong>.<br>
                        <strong>Cumulonimbus (Cb):</strong> These clouds are towering and massive, often associated with
                        intense storms. They symbolize the overflowing, dramatic nature of
                        <strong><em>Tara’</em></strong>, as they are capable of releasing heavy rain and storms, much
                        like a cloud reaching the point of overflow.

                    <h3 class="card-title">3. Jaham</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Jaham</strong> refers to an ignorant or unpleasant person,
                        often associated with a bad attitude or an unappealing facial expression. It is used to describe
                        the harsh, unattractive, or unpleasant aspects of behavior or appearance. <br><br>
                        The term also describes the very edge of darkness, referring to the time of night just before
                        dawn, when it is still fully dark, but the first hints of light have not yet appeared. It
                        signifies the last moments of complete darkness before the break of day, or the first quarter of
                        the night when the night feels most oppressive. <br><br>
                        In the context of clouds, <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> refers to light, weak clouds that hold
                        no water and seem to float aimlessly with the wind. These clouds are seen as lacking substance
                        or purpose, providing no rain or shade. They are metaphorically void of blessings and symbolize
                        the emptiness of a cloud that brings no relief, especially in a harsh desert environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Refers to the time before dawn, the last stage of
                        darkness.
                        <br>

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> clouds evoke a sense of futility, a
                        cloud that lacks substance, purpose, or potential. They embody the feeling of the end of the
                        night before dawn when the world feels stagnant, with no promise of relief or change. The clouds
                        are seen as weak and useless, contributing nothing to the environment.

                        <strong>Cirrostratus (Cs):</strong> These clouds are thin, wispy, and often do not hold any
                        moisture. They are similar to <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong> in that they are light and do not
                        bring any rain or shade, offering no relief in harsh conditions.<br>
                        <strong>Stratus (St):</strong> These clouds are flat and featureless, covering the sky in a
                        dull, monotonous layer. Like <strong><em>Jaham</em></strong>, they are associated with a lack of
                        movement, change, or substance, symbolizing a weak presence in the sky that does not bring the
                        expected rain or shade.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Habaa/Hubi</strong> refers to anything that is close to the
                        ground. Colloquially, the term is used to mean crawling, like something crawling on the ground,
                        such as a baby or animal. Historically it was used to describe a camel’s movement when it lowers
                        itself close to the earth. <br><br>
                        The term is poetically used to describe the trace left behind on the ground, similar to how an
                        arrow leaves a long mark on the ground if it misses the target. I have personally heard
                        (although I couldn't find this in the books) that <strong>Hubi</strong> specifically means after
                        a battle when arrow marks are on the ground, and in the case it rains the next day, the
                        battlefield is filled with these long puddles that reflect the sky. That imagery is what the
                        clouds are meant to look like. And they appear low to the ground and stretch across the sky in
                        thin, streak-like sheets. These clouds evoke the imagery of marks or traces left behind on the
                        earth, just as an arrow might leave a trail in the dirt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Temporal connotation:</strong> Often seen before or during minor weather changes,
                        symbolizing the fleeting nature of time.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Spatial connotation:</strong> No specific spatial connotation mentioned, though evokes
                        the idea of a mark left behind in space.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Notes:</strong> These clouds carry a sense of impermanence and fragility. Their
                        streak-like formations evoke the feeling of something that is briefly visible but not permanent,
                        akin to the mark an arrow leaves on the ground as it misses its target.

                    <p class="card-description">
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Haras</strong> refers to fierce dedication and commitment
                        to something, often used to describe a commitment to protect someone. It can also mean a tear in
                        something, like a tear in fabric or a wound in skin. <br><br>
                        In the context of clouds, <strong>Haras</strong> refers to a cloud that is low to the ground,
                        with heavy rain that seems to fall so forcefully it tears into the face of the Earth. These
                        clouds evoke the imagery of a tearing force, with their rain appearing as though it is cutting

                        that can tear through the environment. Their presence suggests an intense moment, akin to a
                        forceful commitment or action.

                        When used for clouds, <strong>Hayar</strong> refers to clouds that do not move with the wind,
                        seemingly stuck in one place, wandering aimlessly. They are unsure of where to go, unable to

                        Interestingly, the term used for a confused or dazed person comes from this description of the
