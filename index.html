            <br>
            <p>
                as someone who has lived outside of clock time, there is a temporal and spatial experience
                that we are completely blind to, and we've become dependent on a dictated time, without any
                understanding of how we fit in it. this project attempts to rehabilitate our innate sense of time, the
                one we extract from our surroundings, instead of the one blinking on your screen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>here you will find ways to become autonomous in your time and space.

                project here, along with some essays that highlight the framework of this project. finally, here are the

            <h2>how this project is structured</h2>
            <p>
                this project begins with this website, a space dedicated to unraveling the <strong>politics and
                    background of time perception</strong>.
                it invites you to reflect on how time is shaped and standardized across different cultures and how it
                governs our daily lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                then, we explore the concept of <strong>open-source time</strong>. how can we access time outside of
                rigid frameworks?
                what tools and perspectives can help us understand time more intimately and fluidly? this exploration
                will empower
                you to think about time as something personal, rather than dictated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                finally, this thesis is centered around <strong>four distinct maps</strong>â€”each representing a unique
                aspect of time:
                the <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>clouds</strong>, <strong>stars</strong>, and <strong>time
                    itself</strong>. when overlayed,
                these maps create a new lens through which to rebuild and reimagine your perception of time.
