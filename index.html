            <br>
            <p>
                think of how you experience time. your imagination of it, how you live through it, how you imagine past,
                present, and future. where did that imagination come from? why do we think only in seconds, minutes, and
                hours? why does time feel encompassing, all knowing, untouchable, inaccessible? was it always this way?
                <br><br><br>
                as someone who has lived outside of clock time, there is a temporal and spatial experience
                that we are completely blind to, and we've become dependent on a dictated time, without any
                understanding of how we fit in it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                this project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                how can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it? how can we take back time?

                <br><br><br>
                look around you. the sun, the moon, the direction of the wind, the stars, the clouds, the rain, all
                communicate time and space. they are the original clock, calendar, compass, and map. they are the
                original timekeepers.
                <br><br><br>
                without a clock, we are lost. without a calendar, we are lost. without a compass, we are lost. without a
                map, we are lost. how did this happen? how did we become so dependent on these tools? how did we lose
                our connection to the natural world? and who is controlling these tools?
                <a href="https://badriyahs.github.io/ProposeBG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the time and
                    space we have lived by is linear, imperial, politicized, and
                    standardized. the minute is
                    not so innocent.</a>


                <br><br><br>
                take a moment to imagine how people lived before the clock, the calendar, the compass, and the map. how
                did they know when to wake up, when to sleep, when to plant, when to harvest, when to move, when to
                stay, when to celebrate, when to mourn? how did they know where they were, where they were going, where
                they came from?
                <br><br><br>
                if i took away your phone, could you do the same?
                <br><br><br>
                this project promises that you can. and it teaches you how to do it. and with that, you can explore
                temporal imaginaries that stretch beyond time as we know it.

                project here, along with some essays that highlight the framework of this project. finally, here are the

            <h2>how this project is structured</h2>
            <p>
                this project begins with this website, a space dedicated to unraveling the <strong>politics and
                    background of time perception</strong>.
                it invites you to reflect on how time is shaped and standardized across different cultures and how it
                governs our daily lives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                then, we explore the concept of <strong>open-source time</strong>. how can we access time outside of
                rigid frameworks?
                what tools and perspectives can help us understand time more intimately and fluidly? this exploration
                will empower
                you to think about time as something personal, rather than dictated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                finally, this thesis is centered around <strong>four distinct maps</strong>â€”each representing a unique
                aspect of time:
                the <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>clouds</strong>, <strong>stars</strong>, and <strong>time
                    itself</strong>. when overlayed,
                these maps create a new lens through which to rebuild and reimagine your perception of time.
