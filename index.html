            <p>
                think of how you experience time. your imagination of it, how you live through it, how you imagine past,
                present, and future. where did that imagination come from? why do we think only in seconds, minutes, and
                hours? why does time feel encompassing, all knowing, untouchable, inaccessible? was it always this way?
                <br><br><br>
                as someone who has lived outside of clock time, there is a temporal and spatial experience
                that we are completely blind to, and we've become dependent on a dictated time, without any
                understanding of how we fit in it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                this project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                how can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it? how can we take back time?

                <br><br><br>
                look around you. the sun, the moon, the direction of the wind, the stars, the clouds, the rain, all
                communicate time and space. they
                are the original clock, calendar, compass, and map. they are the
                original timekeepers. you measure them with your eyes, the tilt of your head, you can tell time using
                the dimensions of your hands, you can read the sky as easily as you read a clock face. as intuitively as
                you use google maps. and this is how people lived for thousands and thousands of years.
                <br><br><br>
                without a clock, we are lost. without a calendar, we are lost. without a compass, we are lost. without a
                map, we are lost. how did this happen? how did we become so dependent on these tools? where did these
                tools come from? who created them? who enforced them? and why are they so natural to us today?
                <br><br><br>
                how did
                we lose
                our connection to the natural world? who pushed that narrative? who benefits from it?
                <br><br><br>
                the time and
                space we have lived by is linear, imperial, politicized, and
                standardized. the minute is
                not so innocent.<br><br>

            <p>
                this project is meant to serve as a <strong>critique</strong> to how:<br><br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                time is <strong>politicized</strong>. <br>
                time is <strong>imperial</strong>.<br>
                time is <strong>linear</strong>.<br>
                time is <strong>imposed</strong>.<br><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                our devices, our history, our perception of time, and
                our language reflect that.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                take a moment to imagine how people lived before the clock, the calendar, the compass, and the map. how
                did they know when to wake up, when to sleep, when to plant, when to harvest, when to move, when to
                stay, when to celebrate, when to mourn? how did they know where they were, where they were going, where
                they came from?
                <br><br><br>
                if i took away your phone, could you do the same?
                <br><br><br>
                this project promises that you can. and it teaches you how to do it. and with that, you can explore
                temporal imaginaries that stretch beyond time as we know it.
