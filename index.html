            <p>
                think of how you experience time. your imagination of it, how you live through it, how you imagine past,
                present, and future. where did that imagination come from? why do we think only in seconds, minutes, and
                hours? why does time feel encompassing, all knowing, untouchable, inaccessible? was it always this way?
            </p>
            <p>

                as someone who has lived outside of clock time, there is a temporal and spatial experience
                that we are completely blind to, and we've become dependent on a dictated time, without any
                understanding of how we fit in it.
            </p>

            <p>
                this project stems from a deep exploration of the temporal frameworks that govern our lives.
                how can we move beyond rigid, universalized notions of time and reclaim our autonomy over how we
                experience it? how can we take back time?

            </p>
            <p>
                look around you. the sun, the moon, the direction of the wind, the stars, the clouds, the rain, all
                communicate time and space. they
                are the original clock, calendar, compass, and map. they are the
                original timekeepers. you measure them with your eyes, the tilt of your head, you can tell time using
                the dimensions of your hands, you can read the sky as easily as you read a clock face. as intuitively as
                you use google maps. and this is how people lived for thousands and thousands of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                without a clock, we are lost. without a calendar, we are lost. without a compass, we are lost. without a
                map, we are lost. how did this happen? how did we become so dependent on these tools? where did these
                tools come from? who created them? who enforced them? and why are they so natural to us today?
            </p>
            <p>
                how did
                we lose
                our connection to the natural world? who pushed that narrative? who benefits from it?
            </p>
            <p>
                the time and
                space we have lived by is linear, imperial, politicized, and
                standardized. the minute is
                not so innocent.

            <p>
                this project is meant to serve as a <strong>critique</strong> to how:<br><br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                time is <strong>politicized</strong>. <br>
                time is <strong>imperial</strong>.<br>
                time is <strong>linear</strong>.<br>
                time is <strong>imposed</strong>.<br><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                our devices, our history, our perception of time, and
                our language reflect that.
            </p>

            <p>

                take a moment to imagine how people lived before the clock, the calendar, the compass, and the map. how
                did they know when to wake up, when to sleep, when to plant, when to harvest, when to move, when to
                stay, when to celebrate, when to mourn? how did they know where they were, where they were going, where
                they came from?
            </p>
            <p>
                if i took away your phone, could you do the same?
            </p>
            <p>
                this project promises that you can. and it teaches you how to do it. and with that, you can explore
                temporal imaginaries that stretch beyond time as we know it.

                Allocentrism in philosophy and engineering

Computation is not just a tool, anymore than language is just a tool. Both language and computation are constitutive of thought and the encoding and communication of symbolic reasoning. Both evolve in relation to how they affect and are affected by the world, and yet both retain something formally unique. That machine intelligence would evolve through language as much as language will in the foreseeable future evolve through machines suggest a sort of artificial convergent evolution. More on that below.

What does Antikythera mean by “computation” and what is its slice of that spectrum? Our approach is slightly off kilter from how philosophy of computation is, at present, usually practiced. Philosophy, in its Analytic mode, interrogates the mathematical procedure of computation and seeks to qualify those formal properties. It bridges Logic and philosophy of mathematics in often exquisitely productive but sometimes arid ways. Our focus, however, is less in that formal uniqueness than in the mutually-affecting evolution of computation and world, and how each becomes a scaffold for the development of the other.

For its part, Continental Philosophy is suspicious, dismissive and even hostile to computation as a figure of power, reductive thought, and instrumental rationality. It devotes considerable time to the often obscure prosey criticism of all that it imagines computation to be and do. As a rule, both spoken and unspoken, it valorizes the incomputable over the computable, the ineffable over the effable, the analogue over the digital, the poetic over the explanatory, and so on.

Our approach is also qualitative and speculative but instead of seeing philosophy as a form of resistance to computation, it sees computation as a challenge to thought itself. Computation is not that which obscures our view of the real, but which has, over the past century, been the primary enabler of confrontations with the real that are sometimes startling and even disturbing but always precious. This makes us neither optimists nor pessimists, but rather deeply curious and committed to building and rebuilding from first principles rather than commentary on passing epiphenomena.

Our philosophical standpoint is allocentric more than egocentric, “Copernican” more than phenomenological. The presumption is we will as always learn more about ourselves by getting outside our own heads and perspectives, almost always through technological mediation, than we will by private rumination on the experience of interiority or by mistaking culture for history. That said, even from an outside perspective looking back upon ourselves, we (“humans”) are not necessarily the most important thing for philosophy to examine. The vistas are open.

Most sciences grew out of philosophy and did so by stepping outdoors and playfully experimenting with the world as it is. Instead of science composing new technologies to verify its curiosity, the inverse is perhaps even more often the case: new technologies devised for one purpose end up changing what is perceivable and thus what is hypothesized and thus what science seeks. The allocentric turn does not imply that human sapience is not magnificent, but it does locate it differently than it may be used to. It is true that homo sapiens is the species that wrote this and presumably is reading this (the most important reader may be a future LLM) but we are merely the present seat of the intensification of abstract intelligence, which is the real force and actor. We are the medium not the message. If Antikythera might eventually contribute to the philosophical explorations of what in due time becomes a science of understanding the relationship between intelligence and technology (and life) as intertwined planetary phenomena –to ask the questions that can only be answered by that– then we will have truly succeeded.
