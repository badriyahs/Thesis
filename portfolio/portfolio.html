            <p class="smaller-text">this year has been a whirlwind of learning, growth, and exploration into the
                frustrating and wonderful world of computation. i’ve been fortunate to work with incredible
                instructors:
                and
                peers, and this is a collection of some of my favorite projects.</p>

            <p class="smaller-text">
                i came in with a clear goal.
                <strong>summer</strong> was for <strong>temporal explorations</strong>,

                <strong>fall</strong> was for <strong>computational experimentation</strong>,

                and <strong>spring</strong> was to merge the two, creating my thesis project,
                <strong>resistant atlas</strong>.

                <br>
                i’m excited to share my work with you.

                In summary, my technical skill set includes both frontend and backend development, using Python and
                JavaScript. This website, for example, was built entirely from scratch using
                code.
                <br>
                <br>
                many of the projects below include parametric and algorithmic design using Grasshopper for Rhino,
                generating complex geometries and design systems driven by data or logic. I also learned data
                visualization with D3.js.
                <br>
                <br>

                I have also developed and trained AI models for creative and analytical applications,
                performed data analysis and processing using Python (including libraries such as pandas and NumPy), and
                worked with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map, interpret, and visualize spatial datasets.

        <section id="projects" class="section">

            the following research, which started in the
            summer, was ongoing in the
            background during every semester, feeding into every project you will see below.<br><br>
            <u><strong>background:</strong></u>



            <details id="manifesto">
                <summary class="collapse-title">manifesto</summary>

                <div class="bordered-section">

                    <p class="smaller-text">
                        the below manifesto was developed as the project's goals began to materialize: <br><br>



                        1. <strong>"<u>THE GAP</u>".</strong>

                        We know how we started and where we are now, but thousands of years of advanced, valuable
                        iteration is neglected by the way we learn. By not knowing how we got here, we lose valuable
                        truths, and are doomed to repeat avoidable mistakes.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        2. <strong><u>ENVIRONMENTAL LOGIC IS INTUITIVE:</u></strong>

                        A child could do it, and children did do it. We’ve just unlearned it. All you need is your body.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        3. <strong><u>WE HAVE NO SENSE OF SCALE.</u></strong>

                        Or time, or duration, or distance. We imagine and feel these things through tools and screens,
                        forgetting their context.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        4. <strong><u>ORIENTATION IS EVERYTHING:</u></strong>

                        All that you learn and will produce in your life relies on how you know what time it is, and
                        where you are in the world. Everything.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        5. <strong><u>KNOWLEDGE IS DISAPPEARING:</u></strong>

                        More knowledge is completely lost than we could ever fathom. It is being rewritten and skewed at
                        a terrifying, accelerating rate.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        6. <strong><u>IF IT IS NOT MADE COMPUTATIONALLY LEGIBLE, IT <em>WILL</em>
                                DISAPPEAR.</u></strong>

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        7. <strong><u>WE DESIGN TOOLS THAT FLATTEN AND ERASE:</u></strong>

                        There is a way to be efficient, and advanced, without historical amnesia. We can cultivate the
                        field without clearing it.

                        <br>
                        <br>


                        8. <strong><u>WE SET OUR OWN TRAPS:</u></strong>

                        The tools we design have invisible constraints which we mistake for reality, and the phenomena
                        that inspired their framework are forced into an artificial symmetry. That artificial symmetry
                        becomes our reality that we continue to build on.

                    <br>
                    To uncover lost temporal realities, spatial frameworks, and environmental logics, it would be
                    counterintuitive to rely solely on the tools and lenses of the present day. I would only fall into
                    the same traps.
                    <br> <br>
                    I need to look at the world through the eyes of those who lived in it, who interpreted it, and who
                    laid the frameworks for what we know now, to know how to understand the world today.
                    <br><br>

                    These frameworks are often illuminated by the sideways gleam of cultural production. Their traces,
                    often subtle, often scattered, are found in language, poetry, art, tools, materials, and other
                    artifacts of lived experience.
                    <br> <br>

                    The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis - Linguistic Relativism - is the theory that language determines the way
                    people think, and suggests that the language spoken will shape the way one sees the world. When
                    language is perpetuated and built upon, so is that worldview the language operates within. In other
                    words, the language you speak expands, limits, and generally orchestrates your thoughts and
                    worldview.
                    <br> <br>

                    Therefore, to understand how people in the past viewed the world, it would be useful to dive into
                    rich, deep-rooted languages, to possibly reveal long-lost environmental logics that would explain
                    the framework on which we built everything we know today. Or at least serve as a foil to expose the
                    assumptions we have about how time and space are understood today.
                    <br> <br>

                    Arabic is a valuable starting point here, because I speak Arabic, and classical Arabic poetry is how
                    I learned and interpreted some of the sky. However, this project will soon encompass other languages
                    and the forensic piecing these dispersed logics together.

                    <br> <br>

                    For <em>Names of the Sun, Houses of the Moon, Cloudspotter</em> and other <em>Resistant Atlas</em>
                    projects, the main resource is Ibn Qutaybah al-Dinawari’s <em> Kitab al-Anwaa </em>(written in 880
                    CE), a dictionary of meteorological terms, including dozens of words for the sun, the moon, the
                    stars, the wind, the rain, the clouds, and other environmental phenomena. These terms are listed
                    alphabetically, and defined on an aesthetic/poetic basis. No real quantifiable or empirical, a.k.a.
                    'scientific' data regarding use, the time, the area, etc, is listed. No timestamps, heights,
                    coordinates, orbit paths, or meteorology data are listed.

                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="/assets/portfolio-assets/anwaabook.png" alt="an-anwaa book"

                    </div>
                    <br> <br>

                    But assuming Sapir-Whorf's hypothesis, the <em><u>language itself</u></em> is the data. The Western
                    divide between
                    poetry and science is just that. Western. By operating as if the two are not separate, but two sides
                    of the same coin, there is much to be uncovered.

                    <em><u><strong>understanding the sun through a computational lens</strong></u></em>
                    <br> <br>
                    The sun, a celestial body that has guided human perception of time, holds countless meanings across
                    temporal, spiritual, and cultural contexts.

                    In English, the sun is that ball of fire that gives us light, warmth, and life. It gives us time,
                    governs space, keeps the Earth tethered to its orbit, and is the central point that holds everything
                    in place (and in time).

                    However, no matter what, whether it is in the East, the West, high overhead, or underneath the
                    horizon, it is called "the sun". Whether it is in the East, the West, high overhead, underneath the
                    horizon, it holds the same _name_. This is how Western language works.

                    In Arabic, it is a different story.

                    The sun has different names based on where it is in the sky, which season, what time of day, its
                    angle, intensity, behavior, how it is perceived, whether a friend, or an enemy. So, just from the
                    name, you can infer crucial spatial, temporal, and meteorological information.

                    From the Ibn Qutaybah al-Dinawari’s <em> Kitāb al-Anwāʾ </em> (كتاب الأنواء) (The Meteoreological
                    Dictionary mentioned previously) I found 42 words for the sun I could use in my research. Then I
                    conducted the below process to make these words computationally legible to lay the groundwork for
                    future digital tools;

                    </div>
                    <p class="image-caption">A snippet of the research process.</p>


                    1. <strong><u>Read the word in its original context:</u></strong>

                    Examine the word in meteorological, poetic, observational, or even religious sources.

                    <br><br>

                    2. <strong><u>Extract environmental logic:</u></strong>

                    Identify patterns in how it is used contextually, or etymology that may reveal embedded temporal
                    or
                    spatial meaning.

                    <br><br>

                    3. <strong><u>Place within environmental phenomena:</u></strong>

                    Place the word within seasonal cycles, celestial movement, agricultural schedules, atmospheric
                    conditions, etc.

                    <br><br>

                    4. <strong><u>Assign computational parameters:</u></strong>

                    Temporal marker, altitude and azimuth, intensity, spatial connotations.

                    <br><br>

                    5. <strong><u>Reparametrize for x, y, z, symbol, size:</u></strong>

                    Encode those values into the tags outlined in the parametric process which include x y z
                    coordinates, a symbol id, and a size id.

                    <br>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><u><em>Parametric Process:</em></u></strong>

                    <br><br>

                    1. <strong><u>Define primary environmental variables:</u></strong>
                    Map out:
                    - X (solar altitude)
                    - Y (solar azimuth)
                    - Z (temporal-spatial weight)
                    Then also an index for size & symbol.

                    <br><br>

                    2. <strong><u>Assign sun height (X) based on seasons:</u></strong>
                    - X = 0 is maximum altitude at summer solstice
                    - X = 9 is minimum altitude at winter solstice
                    - X = -9 to -18 solar depression angles (civil, nautical, astronomical twilight)

                    <br><br>

                    3. <strong><u>Assign east-west (Y) based on diurnal arc:</u></strong>
                    - Y = 0 is sunrise (maximum east)
                    - Y = 20 is noon (midpoint)
                    - Y = 40 is sunset (maximum west)

                    <br><br>


                    4. <strong><u>Assign temporal-spatial index:</u></strong>
                    The Z-axis scale at 30 indicates a temporal concept (e.g., noon, dusk),
                    and 0 indicates a spatial or navigational concept (e.g., position in relation to land or
                    structures).

                    <br><br>


                    5. <strong><u>Reparametrize for x, y, z, symbol, size:</u></strong>
                    The symbology is highlighted in the next pages, and the size (from 0 to 1) indicates intensity /
                    seeming closeness to the sun.

                    <br><br>


                    6. <strong><u>Input into a parametric system:</u></strong>
                    Using Grasshopper, the parameters are embedded into a dynamic system, which can result in a
                    visualization of the sun’s names as a zone, arc, or duration on the map.

                    the same was repeated for the houses of the moon, which are the lunar stations in which the moon
                    travels
                    through the sky. the moon has 28 houses, and each house has a different name based on its
                    position,
                    and
                    the time of year. the same process was repeated for the clouds, and the stars.

                    the buildings shown in the image,
                    will receive vaarying amounts of daylight based on the time of day and year. The percentages of in
                    sun vs. in shade are compared, and based on that, the new timings are decided on by the algorithm.
                    Ideally this would also include new locations based on where is more comfortable to walk, and new
                    paths leading up to those locations.

                        schedule cycle is what is rigid, while environmental
                        cycles change. In this project, those are flipped, meaning the class schedule is remapped
                        everyday based on the more structed solar cycle. This tool changes
                        which cycle is dependent on the other.

                        of the sky, prompting the larger dial to respond in real time. This interactive component
                        reintroduces the embodied, environmental logic once used to understand the sun, translating it
                        into a contemporary system of orientation and perception. The system integrates Arduino, ESP32,
                        JavaScript, and TouchDesigner.
                        <br><br>
                        The sundial was designed in Rhino and parametrically modeled using Grasshopper. It is calibrated
                        to reflect New York City’s daylight hours across the seasons, effectively functioning like a
                        clock. The final piece was laser-cut from frosted acrylic and mounted onto a
                        potentiometer, which sends live data into the TouchDesigner system, controlling the real-time
                        projection.
                    </p>

                    <p>In addition to the sundial, a book was created to document the research and design process,
                        including the history of each of the sun names, their cultural significance, and the technical
                        aspects of
                        each sun position. The book serves as a companion piece to the installation.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>reverse sundial (daytime use)</em></strong></p>
                    <p>A 5-ft diameter acrylic reverse sundial that uses the sun’s gleam (instead of its shadow) to
                        reveal which sun from Resistant Atlas: Names of the Sun corresponds to the sun overhead.
                        Rather than telling time, it translates the sun’s visual alignment into definitions drawn from
                        the meteorology archives. The main takeaway is that the time is told from the perception of how
                        the sun feels and appears, rather than astronomical accuracy.
                        <br><br>
                        (Which, in the context of my research, is more important anyway. See the essay “It’s Inaccurate?
                        Even Better!” on the website.)

                    <p><strong><em>interactive projection (nighttime/indoor use)</em></strong></p>
                    <p>The reverse sundial is paired with an interactive projection that displays the sun names from
                        Resistant Atlas, allowing viewers to explore the meanings and cultural significance of each
                        name. The projection is triggered by the sundial’s position, creating a dynamic interaction
                        between the physical and digital elements of the installation.</p>
